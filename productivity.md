# Special Theory of Productivity

I call this my "special theory of productivity" because it is focused on the problems I've seen with productively creating software in a team (and "agile") environment.

## Responsibilities... and Authority?

Everyone talks about responsibilities, and job postings have endless lists of them, but no one talks about the authority that people have. Or to put it in another way, does anyone have any authority? Can anyone actually decide something and not be passive-aggressively ignored?

In my experience, people react in two ways to being told they have to participate at work, but then are basically ignored:
* They quit.
* They put in the absolute minimum effort to keep their job -- they "tune out".

## The Three Types of People At Work

* The person with the money.
* The person who wants something built.
* The person who can build it.

Sometimes a single person will know what to build and have the money. Oftentimes the person who can build it is a team of software engineers, testers, designers, writers, operations, etc. But at the end of the day those three "people" have to have consensus about the project. Leaving out one or two of them during decision making is only going to lead to problems because assumptions will be made. For example, the PM and PO deciding amongst themselves that a bunch of features can be done in the next quarter.

Another danger is that the wrong people end up arguing with each other, which happened at a company I worked at. The architect wanted a new feature added to the project so we estimated it would take a month. But then the PO asked us to justify its inclusion, instead of the architect (who is the person who wanted it to be built). Since we were the people who were building it, not the person who wanted it, we couldn't explain why it was necessary. So it got cut.

## Pick Any Three

It'd be nice to build a competitor to Apple in a month, but that's impossible because you can only control three areas out of the following four:

Area | Comments
---- | --------
Cost | The amount of money being spent (usually relates to the number of people involved).
Quality | The quality of the software's implementation.
Scope | The software's features.
Time | How much time the team has.

Specifically, it is the team of software engineers, testers, etc, that has control over the software's quality.

Note: "agile" is basically all about fixing the areas of Cost, Quality, and Time, but allowing Scope to change dynamically.

## To Summarize

1. Determine which people have authority.
1. Determine who is paying for things, who wants things to be built, and who can build them.
1. Decide on an area (Cost, Quality, Scope, or Time) that can change dynamically.

Crucially, the 3rd point is the hardest because who gets to decide it? Ideally, consensus is reached amongst the "three types of people" because none of them can overrule the others.

## To Summarize the Summary

Clarity and productivity go hand-in-hand. Passive-aggressiveness will destroy your company.
