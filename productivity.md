## Special Theory of Productivity

I call this my "special theory of productivity" because it is focused on the problems I've seen with productively creating software in a team (and "agile") environment.

## Responsibilities... and Authority?

Everyone talks about responsibilities, and job postings have endless lists of them, but no one talks about what authority each person on the team has.


Balance of power
Resentment, quit
Give up, stay but things fall apart


## The Three Types of People At Work

* The person with the money.
* The person who wants something built.
* The person who can build it.

Sometimes a single person will know what to build and have the money. Oftentimes the person who can build it is a team of software engineers, testers, designers, writers, operations, etc. But at the end of the day those three "people" have to have consensus about the project. Leaving out one or two of them during decision making is only going to lead to problems because assumptions will be made. For example, the PM and PO deciding amongst themselves that a bunch of features can be done in the next quarter.

Another danger is that the wrong people end up arguing with each other, which happened at a company I worked at. The architect wanted a new feature added to the project so we estimated it would take a month. But then the PO asked us to justify its inclusion, instead of the architect (who is the person who wanted it to be built). Since we were the people who were building it, not the person who wanted it, we couldn't explain why it was necessary. So it got cut.

## Pick Three

It'd be nice to build a competitor to Apple in a month, but that's impossible because you can only control three out of the following four:

Area | Comments
---- | --------
Cost | The amount of money being spent.
Quality | The quality of the software's implementation.
Scope | The software's features.
Time | How much time the team has.


## To Wrap Up

choose 3 out of 4, make sure the right 3 people are talking, and figure out everyone's responsibilities and who has what kind of authority.
