I am a Senior Software Engineer with over a decade of Java experience. Currently seeking remote contract work -- I can be reached at greg.gabelmann@gmail.com or through my profiles at LinkedIn or Github (see below).

## WIP

This page is a work in progress.

## I like to:

* Do "full lifecycle" development because every part of software engineering is important, interesting, and necessary.
* Release projects to Production frequently.
* Work with people who are results-focused, but also take time to help each other.
* Create my own software libraries to understand how things really work. (See my [Github Profile](https://github.com/ggabelmann/) for some examples.)

## Posts

From time-to-time I like to write short emails to friends and colleagues about interesting things I've read or learned. (They're also handy references for me to go back to.) Since I'm not on social media these days I've collected some of them here as "posts".

* [One-on-One Meetings](one-on-ones.md)
* [Value types and Shifting Boundaries](values.md)
