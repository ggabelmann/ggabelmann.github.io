I have over a decade of experience delivering multi-tier applications. My expertise is with Java and other server-side technology, but over the years I've worked with numerous languages and frameworks. Currently seeking remote full-time and/or contract work -- I can be reached at greg.gabelmann@gmail.com or through my profiles at LinkedIn or Github (see below).

## I like to:

* Participate in all phases of the software development life-cycle because every part is important, interesting, and necessary.
* Release projects to Production frequently.
* Work with people who are results-focused, but also take time to help each other.
* Create my own software libraries to understand how things really work.

## Projects

Most of my side-projects are open source and available from my [Github Profile](https://github.com/ggabelmann/). Some of the more interesting ones are:

* [jcrawl](https://github.com/ggabelmann/jcrawl), a java-based web crawler that supports threads and rate-limiting.
* [NetpbmTools](https://github.com/ggabelmann/NetpbmTools), an F#-based tool for doing simple manipulations to images.
* [NeuroEvolution](https://github.com/ggabelmann/NeuroEvolution), a java-based neural network that can evolve.

## Technical Writing

I enjoy writing about interesting things I've recently read or learned. (They're also handy references for me to go back to.) Since I'm not on social media these days I've collected some of them here:

* [Special Theory of Productivity](productivity.md)
* [One-on-One Meetings](one-on-ones.md)
* [Functional Objects and Shifting Boundaries](values.md)
